<h1>License Zero Developer’s Guide</h1>
<p>License Zero is a game plan for financially sustaining independent work on open software.  License Zero lets you make a new deal with users of your software:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Use my software freely for open source or noncommercial work.  Otherwise, buy a license online to support me.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It’s the model of <a href="https://github.com/pricing">GitHub</a>, <a href="https://travis-ci.com/plans">Travis CI</a>, and other leading developer services, adapted for independent library, framework, and tools developers.  Finally.</p>
<p>This model also makes it easy to support developers creating open software you use and rely on at work.  License Zero is not a donation platform or a backer-rewards market.  If other developers’ work helps you do your job better or more efficiently, supporting them through License Zero ought to be a reimbursable expense.</p>
<p>This is a guide to License Zero, and the project’s primary documentation for developers.  If you’re interested in using License Zero, either to support your work or to support others, read this guide.  If you find errors or ways to improve it, send a <a href="https://github.com/licensezero/guide.licensezero.com">pull request</a>.</p>
<p>This guide describes what License Zero is, and how it works.  It is <em>not</em> a substitute for legal advice about whether a particular license fits your needs or work.  The License Zero <a href="https://licensezero.com/terms/service">terms of service</a> apply to this guide, too.</p>

<p>As an independent software developer, you control who can use your software, and under what terms.  License Zero <code>LICENSE</code> terms give everyone broad permission to use and build with your software, as long as they either limit commercial use or share work they build on yours back as open source, depending on your choice of two <code>LICENSE</code> options.  Users who can’t meet those conditions need private licenses.</p>
<p><a href="https://licensezero.com">licensezero.com</a> can sell private licenses on your behalf.  A <a href="https://github.com/licensezero/cli">command line interface</a> makes it easy for users to buy all the private licenses they need for a project at once, with a single credit card transaction.  <a href="https://stripe.com">Stripe</a> processes payments directly to an account in your name.  The same command line interface makes it easy for you to sign up, start offering private licenses for sale, and set pricing.</p>
<p>This “dual licensing” model is not new.  <a href="https://www.mysql.com/about/legal/licensing/oem/">MySQL</a> pioneered it decades ago, and important projects like <a href="https://www1.qt.io/licensing/">Qt</a> and <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/community/licensing">MongoDB</a> continue it, successfully, today.  License Zero evolves the dual licensing model by making it useful for more kinds of software, and by making it practical for independent developers who can’t or don’t want to set up companies.</p>
<h2><a id="public-licenses">Public Licenses</a></h2>
<p>License Zero starts where you exercise your power as the owner of intellectual property in your work: in your project’s <code>LICENSE</code> file.  You might currently use <a href="https://spdx.org/licenses/MIT">The MIT License</a>, <a href="https://spdx.org/licenses/BSD-2-Clause">a BSD license</a>, or a similar open source license there now.  License Zero offers you two alternatives:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><a id="prosperity"></a><a href="https://licensezero.com/licenses/prosperity">The Prosperity Public License</a> (<dfn>Prosperity</dfn>) works a bit like a <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/">Creative Commons NonCommercial license</a>, but for software.  Prosperity gives everyone broad permission to use your software, but limits commercial use to a short trial period of 32 days.  When a commercial user’s trial runs out, they need to buy a private license or stop using your software.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a id="parity"></a><a href="https://licensezero.com/licenses/parity">The Parity Public License</a> (<dfn>Parity</dfn>) works a bit like <a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.html">AGPL</a>, but requires users to release more of their own code, in more situations.  Parity requires users who change, build on, or use your work to create software to release that software as open source, too.  If users can’t or won’t release their work, they need to buy a private license that allows use without sharing back.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Both <code>LICENSE</code> options are short and readable.  You should <a href="https://licensezero.com/licenses/prosperity">read</a> <a href="https://licensezero.com/licenses/parity">them</a>.</p>
<h3><a id="comparing-public-licenses">Comparing Public Licenses</a></h3>
<p>The two <code>LICENSE</code> options aren’t just worded differently.  They achieve different results.  Abstracting them a bit:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">def prosperity_license:
  if commercial_user:
    if within_trial_period:
      return 'free to use'
    else:
      return 'need to buy a private license'
  else:
    return 'free to use'

def parity_license:
  if building_software:
    if release_software_as_open_source:
      return 'free to use'
    else:
      return 'need to buy a private license'
  else:
    return 'free to use'
</code></pre>
<p>Consider a few user scenarios, and how they play out under different <code>LICENSE</code> choices:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>A developer employed at a for-profit company wants to use your library in their company’s closed-source, proprietary web app.  They will <em>not</em> release their web app as open source.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>If you license the library under <a href="#prosperity">The Prosperity Public License</a>, the developer can only use the library for 32 days.  Then they need to buy a private license.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you license the library under <a href="#parity">The Parity Public License</a>, the developer needs to buy a private license to use your library in their web app at all.  They can’t use the library under its public license, because they won’t meet the condition of releasing their web app as open source.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>A developer employed at a for-profit company wants to use your library in the data synchronization software their company ships with voice recorders.  They plan to release the sync software as open source.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>If you license the library under <a href="#prosperity">The Prosperity Public License</a>, the developer can only use the library for 32 days.  Then they need to buy a private license.  The private license allows the developer to “sublicense”, or pass down, their permission to use the library for commercial purposes to their company and its customers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you license the library under <a href="#parity">The Parity Public License</a>, the developer can use the library in their sync software under the public license, as long as they actually release the sync software as open source.  The company’s customers can use the sync software, with the library, for any purpose.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>A developer employed at a for-profit company wants to use your video player application to show commercials in their office lobby.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>If your license the application under <a href="#prosperity">The Prosperity Public License</a>, the developer can only use the application for 32 days.  Then they need to buy a private license.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you license the application under <a href="#parity">The Parity Public License</a>, the developer is free to use the application for as long as they like under the public license.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p><a href="#prosperity">The Prosperity Public License</a> allows users to build and use closed and proprietary software with your work, as long they use it for noncommercial purposes.  <a href="#parity">The Parity Public License</a> allows users to build and use only open source software with your work, even for very profit-driven purposes.  Many noncommercial software users are happy to make their work open source, but many make closed software, too.  Many for-profit companies make closed software, but many also make and release open source software, too.</p>
<p>License Zero was inspired by imbalances in the relationship between open source developers and users.  Both <code>LICENSE</code> options represent new deals between developers and users, designed to redress that imbalance.  Whether <a href="#prosperity">Prosperity</a> or <a href="#parity">Parity</a> works best depends on how others will use your project, and your goals.  Before you pick terms for <code>LICENSE</code>, make a few notes about how you think users will use and build on your software.  Treat those use scenarios as your licensing test suite.  Run your test suite examples through the rules in <a href="#prosperity">Prosperity</a> and <a href="#parity">Parity</a>, to see how they will play out, and compare the results.  Which results do you prefer?</p>
<p>A key consideration for applications is whether you want to require users to buy private licenses for commercial use.  Say you write an image manipulation program.   <a href="#parity">Parity</a> would allow anyone to use your program for any purpose, including commercial purposes, so long as they don’t modify your program or build on it to make closed source.  That’s unlikely for an image manipulation program, as compared to a software library or a software development tool.  On the other hand, <a href="#prosperity">Prosperity</a> would require users to buy a private license after 32 days.</p>
<h3><a id="license-politics">License Politics</a></h3>
<p>The differences between the public licenses, especially on commercial use, reflect some political differences that you should be aware of.</p>
<p><a href="#prosperity">Prosperity</a> is not an “open source” or “free software” license as nearly any savvy community members define those terms, because it discriminates against commercial use.  Source for <a href="#prosperity">Prosperity</a> software can still be published and developed online, using many popular services like <a href="https://github.com">GitHub</a> and <a href="https://www.npmjs.com">npm</a>.  But many in those communities will not accept it as part of their movements, and perhaps criticize you for referring to it as “open source” or “free software”.</p>
<p><a href="#parity">Parity</a>, on the other hand, was written to conform to the <a href="https://opensource.org/osd">Open Source Definition</a>, as was its predecessor, a license called The License Zero Reciprocal Public License.  The predecessor license was proposed to the <a href="http://lists.opensource.org/pipermail/license-review_lists.opensource.org/">Open Source Initiative’s license-review mailing list</a> for approval in September of 2017.  Extensive debate eventually focused on the fact that L0‑R goes further than existing licenses in when and what code it requires users to release.  When it became clear that debate would not resolve favorably, if at all, <a href="#parity">Parity</a> was born, as a fork of L0‑R, eschewing the constraints of the OSI process.  It’s the author’s position that <a href="#parity">Parity</a> conforms to the Open Source Definition as written, resembles licenses that OSI has approved in the past, and that software under <a href="#parity">Parity</a> is therefore open source software.  Others will disagree.</p>
<p><a href="#parity">Parity</a> is probably not a “free software” license <a href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html">as defined by the Free Software Foundation</a>.  FSF’s definition of free software requires granting freedoms to run, copy, distribute, study, change and improve software.  It also recognizes that some conditions on those freedoms can enhance software freedom overall by ensuring that others receive source code and freedom to work with it, which is exactly the approach <a href="#parity">Parity</a> takes.  However, FSF’s definition of free software admits only conditions on the freedom to share modified versions with others, along the lines of the GPL licenses that FSF has published, and not conditions on other freedoms.  That partially explains why the Open Source Initiative <a href="https://opensource.org/licenses/RPL-1.5">approved RPL‑1.5</a>, a thematic predecessor of <a href="#parity">Parity</a>, while FSF <a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/license-list.en.html#RPL">considers RPL non-free</a>.</p>
<p>In the end, your software is yours to license.  These politics may or may not matter to you, and they may or may not matter to your users or potential users.</p>
<h2><a id="private-licenses">Private Licenses</a></h2>
<p>Users who can’t meet the conditions of the public <code>LICENSE</code> terms can buy a private license that allows them to use the work without meeting those conditions.  License Zero publishes a <a href="https://licensezero.com/licenses/private">form private license</a>, and sells private licenses to users on developers’ behalf.</p>
<p>Each private license grants the buyer broad permission under copyright and patent law to use contributions to an open software project, in language a bit more like what a company legal department would expect.  Otherwise, the legal effect is much like that of a permissive public license, like MIT or BSD, except the private license applies only to the person who bought it, from the date they bought it.</p>
<h3><a id="private-sublicensing">Private Sublicensing</a></h3>
<p>Private licenses give the buyer limited ability to pass their licenses on, or sublicense, others.  Generally speaking, buyers can pass their licenses on to others if they build software with significant additional functionality over and above that of the License Zero code they use.  They can pass on only the right to use the License Zero as part of the new program they’ve created, and to maintain it.  They <em>can’t</em> pass on their license to make changes or build other programs with the software.  In other words, buyers can sublicense the “user” parts of their private licenses, but not the “developer” parts of their private licenses.  Other developers who want to develop new programs, commercially or as closed source, need to buy their own private licenses.</p>
<h3><a id="private-license-scope">Private License Scope</a></h3>
<p>Private licenses last forever, and cover the set of contributions to an open software project that a developer tags with the same <a href="#identifiers">identifier</a> listed in the private license.  To use an open software project without following the rules of its public licenses, users need other licenses, like private licenses from licensezero.com, that cover every contribution to the project.</p>
<p>Once a developer publishes contributions to a project tagged with a particular identifier, those contributions become forever linked to that identifier.  Developers can’t take those contributions back, so that private licenses sold for for that identifier no longer cover them.  That means users can buy the private licenses required for a particular version of a project, and rest assured that they will always have the rights they need for that version.</p>
<p>Apart from this rule against taking contributions back, developers retain total control over what work is covered by a particular identifier.  If a developer embarks on a rewrite, or adds significant new functionality in a major release, they can create a new identifier for that new work, and charge for it separately.  If the new work builds on the old work, users will need private licenses for both identifiers to use the combined project.</p>
<p>In general, there is only one situation where License Zero ever signs any agreement that requires a developer to do work in the future: When a customer sponsors <a href="#relicensing">relicensing</a> of a set of contributions, the developer must implement the change, according to instructions in the <a href="#relicense-agreement">relicense agreement</a>. Otherwise, License Zero terms only cover work that has already been done. Developers can <em>choose</em> to make additional contributions tagged with old identifiers.  But they can always choose to use a new identifier instead.</p>
<h3><a id="not-subscriptions">Not Subscriptions</a></h3>
<p>Many companies sell proprietary software on subscription. Customers pay a license fee, usually monthly or annually, as long as they use the software.  Subscriptions create recurring revenue for sellers.  Customers continue to pay, month after month, year after year, even if the seller doesn’t release any changes to the software.</p>
<p>License Zero does not support subscriptions. Customers pay for private licenses just once, and those licenses last forever.  That design decisions reflects the complexity of subscription licensing, on the one hand, and License Zero’s overarching goal of zero friction, on the other.</p>
<p>Subscription license sellers have to charge their customers repeatedly.  Each payment can go wrong.  Payment methods expire.  Delays and errors abound.  Customers go out of business, or decide not to renew.  To cope, sellers pay payment processing and invoice companies, hire billing managers, and even sell debts to collection agencies.</p>
<p>From the customer point of view, sellers go out of business, retire products and services, or let contracts expire to renegotiate price.  To avoid getting stranded, customers demand <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source_code_escrow">source code escrow</a>, transition services, and other protections against getting stuck without critical software. They push for long price commitments, or rules limiting how much prices can go up each year.</p>
<p>All of that complicates subscription license agreements.  But even the best subscription license agreement eventually ends.  When a subscription ends, for whatever reason, the customer’s license for the software ends with it.  Looking at an old proprietary software license, it’s rarely clear if the license is still good.   Did one side or the other stop it from renewing?  Did the payment for this year’s renewal actually go through?</p>
<p>That uncertainty makes anything like a single form for private license, or <a href="#as-a-user">a single command to find what licenses are missing</a>, impossible.  One-time payments and forever licenses are simpler, both at the time of sale and over the long term.</p>
<p>That doesn’t mean developers can’t use License Zero to get paid for work over time.  As <a href="#private-license-scope">mentioned above</a>, developers have complete control over whether to make new contributions under an existing licensing identifier, or create a new one.  Developers can create new identifiers for each new major release of a project, or even for each new month.  It’s up to developers to communicate those choices to users, if they like, so users know what to expect.  As a baseline, License Zero’s licenses and terms only grant licenses for the software developers have already made, in the past.  But licenses for past work don’t expire in the future.</p>
<h2><a id="waivers">Waivers</a></h2>
<p>Waivers work a bit like freebie private licenses.  Developers can use the <a href="#command-line-interface">command line interface</a> to generate signed <a href="https://licensezero.com/licenses/waiver">waivers</a>, for specific people, that let them out of <code>LICENSE</code> conditions limiting commercial use or require open source release.  Developers can generate waivers that last only a set number of days, or that last forever.  The <a href="#command-line-interface">command line interface</a> treats waivers just like private licenses for purposes of figuring out which private licenses a user is missing for a project.</p>
<p>You might like to issue waivers to reward other contributors to your project who make their work available under a permissive license, for <a href="#parallel-licensing">parallel licensing</a>, extend the free trial period for projects under <a href="#prosperity">Prosperity</a>, or to resolve a question about whether a particular use will trigger the commercial-use time limit.  It’s entirely up to you.</p>
<h2><a id="relicensing">Relicensing</a></h2>
<p>License Zero allows developers to set a price for changing the <code>LICENSE</code> terms for their contributions to a project to those of <a href="https://licensezero.com/licenses/charity">The Charity Public License (Charity)</a>.  This is called “relicensing”.</p>
<h3><a id="permissive-license">Permissive License</a></h3>
<p><a href="https://licensezero.com/licenses/charity">Charity</a> is a highly permissive open source software license, much like <a href="https://spdx.org/licenses/MIT">The MIT License</a> and <a href="https://spdx.org/licenses/BSD-2-Clause">the two-clause BSD license</a>, but easier to read and more legally complete.  It gives everyone who receives a copy of your software permission under copyright and patent law to use it and built with it in any way they like, as long as they preserve your license information in copies they give to others and refrain from suing users of your project for violating patents on it.</p>
<p>Relicensing contributions to a project under Charity removes any reason for users to buy private licenses for those contributions through licensezero.com.  Under the <a href="https://licensezero.com/terms/agency">agency terms</a> that you must agree to in order to offer private licenses through License Zero, you must retract an identifier from sale through the API if you relicense it.</p>
<h3><a id="relicense-agreement">Relicense Agreement</a></h3>
<p>The <a href="https://licensezero.com/licenses/relicense">relicense agreement</a> sets out the terms of agreement between a contributor and a sponsor paying to relicense their contributions.  When a sponsor pays the price, <a href="#artless-devices">Artless Devices</a> signs the relicense agreement with the sponsor on the contributor’s behalf, as their agent.</p>
<p>The contributor’s obligations are set out in the “Relicensing” section of the agreement.  Once the contributor receives payment, they’re obligated to take the steps listed there.</p>
<h2><a id="licensezero.com">licensezero.com</a></h2>
<p>licensezero.com is a website and API for selling <a href="#private-licenses">private licenses</a>, closing <a href="#relicensing">relicense deals</a>, and generating <a href="#waivers">waivers</a>.</p>
<p>You can think of licensezero.com as a kind of Internet vending machine.  As a contributor, you can make a deal with the operator of the vending machine to stock it with private licenses and relicense deals for sale.  The vending machine then handles taking payment and spitting out licenses on your behalf.</p>
<p>You could also think of licensezero.com as a kind of e-commerce platform service-izing the back-office operations of a dual licensing business: negotiation, communication, payment processing, records management.  Rather than start a company and hire people to handle those tasks, or take time away from development to do them yourself, you can use licensezero.com to run your licensing business 24/7.  It works just a well for expensive licenses priced in the thousands of dollars and relatively cheap licenses costing just a few bucks.</p>
<h3><a id="stripe-connect">Stripe Connect</a></h3>
<p>You can create an account to sell private licenses through License Zero by linking a standard <a href="https://stripe.com">Stripe</a> payment processing account, via <a href="https://stripe.com/connect">Stripe Connect</a>.  Stripe Connect enables licensezero.com to connect its Stripe account to yours, then generate access keys to initiate payment processing requests directly on your account.  Stripe assesses its fee, and any commission for licensezero.com, on the transaction.</p>
<h3><a id="identifiers">Identifiers</a></h3>
<p>licensezero.com generates unique identifiers for each developer and each set of contributions.  The identifiers are version 4 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier">UUIDs</a> like:</p>
<pre><code>daf5a8b1-23e0-4a9f-a6c1-69c40c71816b
</code></pre>
<h3><a id="cryptography">Cryptography</a></h3>
<p>When you connect a Stripe account to licensezero.com, the site creates a unique UUID for you, as well as a <a href="https://nacl.cr.yp.to/">NaCl</a>-style <a href="https://ed25519.cr.yp.to/software.html">Ed25519</a> cryptographic signing keypair.  licensezero.com signs most kind of licensing information, from package metadata to <code>LICENSE</code> files, private licenses, waivers, and relicensing agreements, with the keypair created for your account, as well as its own keypair.</p>
<p>licensezero.com publishes the public signing key generated for you on your web store pages, and via the API.  Users can leverage the <a href="#command-line-interface">command line interface</a> to verify signatures on private licenses and other documents against the public key.</p>
<p>licensezero.com will not share the secret signing key generated for you with you or anyone else.  But using the API, through the command line interface, you can have licensezero.com sign <a href="#waivers">waivers</a> and package metadata using the key, on your behalf.</p>

<h2><a id="artless-devices">Artless Devices</a></h2>
<p>Artless Devices LLC is a California limited liability company.  It serves as the legal counterpart to licensezero.com.  As a developer offering private licenses for sale through licensezero.com, you will have three legal relationships with Artless Devices:</p>
<h3><a id="service-provider">Service Provider</a></h3>
<p>To use licensezero.com and its API, you must agree to <a href="https://licensezero.com/terms/service">terms of service</a> with Artless Devices.  The terms were written to be read, and you should read them.  They set important rules about responsibility and liability, and make very explicit that Artless Devices isn’t going to provide, or be responsible for, any legal advice about whether License Zero is right for you or your work.</p>
<h3><a id="licensing-agent">Licensing Agent</a></h3>
<p>To offer private licenses for sale through licensezero.com, you agree to the <a href="https://licensezero.com/terms/agency">agency terms</a> with Artless Devices.  You should definitely read that agreement, and again, it was written to be read, not to glaze your eyes over.  But there are a few especially important aspects, from Artless Devices’ point of view.</p>
<p>First and foremost, you appoint Artless Devices as your agent to sign license agreements, waivers, and relicense agreements on your behalf.  That means that Artless Devices can do the deals you authorize through the API, via licensezero.com, with the same effect as if you’d signed them yourself.</p>
<p>Second, Artless Devices earns commission on private license sales.  The amount is set out in the agency terms when you offer your work for private licensing.</p>
<p>Third, you guarantee that you have the rights to offer the software you offer to license through License Zero, and to keep your projects’ metadata in line with what the <a href="#command-line-interface">command line interface</a> generates.  The guarantee helps protect Artless Devices from those trying to take license fees for others’ work.  Your promise about metadata helps ensure that the <a href="#command-line-interface">command line interface</a> works as intended for users buying licenses.</p>
<p>Fourth, the relationship isn’t exclusive, and with the exception of work <a href="#locks">for which you lock availability</a>, either side can end it at any time.  You can sell private licenses through other services, or on your own.</p>
<p>Finally, neither the terms of service nor the agency terms change ownership of any intellectual property in your work.  You own your rights, and you keep them.  Artless Devices doesn’t receive a license from you.  Rather, you license users and agree to relicense your work directly.  Artless Devices merely acts as your agent, signing on your behalf, as you’ve directed via the API.</p>
<h3><a id="toolmaker">Toolmaker</a></h3>
<p>Artless Devices owns and licenses the intellectual property in the <a href="#command-line-interface">command line interface</a> that you will use to register and offer licenses for sale, as well as <a href="https://github.com/licensezero">forms and other software tools published online</a>.</p>
<h2><a id="command-line-interface">Command Line Interface</a></h2>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/licensezero/cli">command line interface</a> is the primary way developers interact with licensezero.com.</p>
<p>Install the CLI by <a href="https://github.com/licensezero/cli/releases/latest">downloading a prebuilt binary for your platform</a> and installing in your <code>$PATH</code>.</p>
<h3><a id="identify-yourself">Identify Yourself</a></h3>
<p>To use the CLI as a contributor, user, or both, first run <code>licensezero identify</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">licensezero identify \
  --name &quot;Jane Dev&quot; \
  --jurisdiction &quot;US-CA&quot; \
  --email &quot;jane@example.com&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>Provide your exact legal name, an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-2">ISO 3166-2</a> code for your tax jurisdiction, and your e-mail address.</p>
<p>A few example tax jurisdictions:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>BR-SP</code> for São Paulo, Brazil</li>
<li><code>DE-HH</code> for Hamburg, Germany</li>
<li><code>GB-LND</code> for the City of London</li>
<li><code>JP-13</code> for Tokyo, Japan</li>
<li><code>NG-LA</code> for Lagos, Nigeria</li>
<li><code>US-TX</code> for Texas, United States</li>
</ul>
<h3>As a Contributor <a id="as-a-contributor"></a></h3>
<h4><a id="registering">Registering</a></h4>
<p>To offer private licenses for sale via <a href="https://licensezero.com">licensezero.com</a>, you need to <a href="#identify-yourself">identify yourself</a> with <code>licensezero identify</code>, then register as a licensor and connect a standard <a href="https://stripe.com">Stripe</a> account:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">licensezero register
</code></pre>
<p><code>licensezero register</code> will open a page in your browser where you can log into Stripe, or create an account and connect it.  Once you’ve connected a Stripe account, <a href="https://licensezero.com">licensezero.com</a> will provide you a licensor identifier and an access token that you can use to create a licensor profile:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">licensezero token --licensor $YOU_NEW_ID
</code></pre>
<p>The command will then prompt for your access token, and save it for future use.</p>
<h4><a id="offering-private-licenses">Offering Private Licenses</a></h4>
<p>To offer private licenses:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">licensezero offer \
  --price 300 \
  --no-relicense \
  --homepage &quot;http://example.com&quot; \
  --description &quot;an example project&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>If you like, you can also set a <a href="#relicensing">relicensing</a> price:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">licensezero offer \
  --price 300 \
  --relicense 200000 \
  --homepage &quot;http://example.com&quot; \
  --description &quot;an example project&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>You can run the <code>reprice</code> subcommand to update pricing.</p>
<p>Once you’ve offered your work, use the CLI to set licensing metadata and <code>LICENSE</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">cd your-package
licensezero license --id $ID --prosperity
# or
licensezero license --id $ID --parity
git add licensezero.json LICENSE
git commit -m &quot;License Zero&quot;
git push
</code></pre>
<p>These commands will write cryptographically signed <code>LICENSE</code> and <code>licensezero.json</code> files.  The data in <code>licensezero.json</code> allow the CLI to identify the package for users quoting and buying private licenses.</p>
<h4><a id="locks">Locks</a></h4>
<p>By default, you can change pricing for private licenses at any time.  You could offer private licenses for $5 today, and $5,000 tomorrow.</p>
<p>In order to provide a publicly verifiable guarantee of license availability and pricing, either to users or others who want to <a href="#stacked-licensing">build on your work</a>, you can lock private-license pricing for your work to no more than the current price for a term of days, months, or even years.</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">licensezero lock --id $ID --unlock $YOUR_UNLOCK_DATE
</code></pre>
<p>The unlock date must be a date at least seven calendar days in the future.</p>
<p>Locking pricing prevents you from increasing pricing or withdrawing your offer of private licenses.  For specifics, see <a href="https://licensezero.com/terms/agency">the agency terms</a>.</p>
<p>Please note that <em>locks are irrevocable</em>.  Artless Devices will not unlock early under any circumstances.</p>
<h4><a id="generating-waivers">Generating Waivers</a></h4>
<p>To generate a waiver, provide a legal name, a jurisdiction code, and either a term in calendar days or <code>forever</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">licensezero waive \
  --id $ID \
  --beneficiary &quot;Eve Able&quot; \
  --jurisdiction &quot;US-NY&quot; \
  --days 90 \
  &gt; waiver.json
</code></pre>
<p>You can also issue waivers that don’t expire:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">licensezero waive \
  --id $ID \
  --beneficiary &quot;Eve Able&quot; \
  --jurisdiction &quot;US-NY&quot; \
  --forever \
  &gt; waiver.json
</code></pre>
<h4><a id="retracting-projects"></a><a id="retracting">Retracting from Sale</a></h4>
<p>Unless you’ve <a href="#locks">locked pricing</a>, you can stop offering private licenses through licensezero.com at any time:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">licensezero retract --id $ID
</code></pre>
<p>Please note that under the <a href="https://licensezero.com/terms/agency">agency terms</a>, Artless Devices can complete private license and relicensing transactions that began before you retracted the project, but can’t start new transactions.</p>
<h3>As a User <a id="as-a-user"></a></h3>
<h3>Quoting and Buying</h3>
<p>You can generate quotes for License Zero software within the <code>node_modules</code> directories of your projects:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">cd your-project
licensezero quote
</code></pre>
<p>To buy missing licenses for dependencies of a project:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">cd you-project
licensezero buy
</code></pre>
<p><code>licensezero buy</code> will open a webpage in your browser listing the licenses to buy and taking credit card payment.  On successful purchase, <a href="https://licensezero.com">licensezero.com</a> will provide the address of a purchase bundle that you can use to import all of the licenses you’ve just purchased at once:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">licensezero import --bundle $URL
</code></pre>
<h4>Importing License and Waiver Files</h4>
<p>To import a license you bought on licensezero.com, or a waiver you received from a contributor:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">licensezero import license.json
licensezero import waiver.json
</code></pre>
<h4>Sponsoring Projects</h4>
<p>To sponsor relicensing of a project onto permissive terms:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">licensezero sponsor --id $ID
</code></pre>
<p>The command will open a payment page in your web browser.</p>
<h3><a id="back-up-your-data">Back Up Your Data</a></h3>
<p>To back up all your License Zero data, including your identity, access token, waivers, and licenses:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">licensezero backup
</code></pre>
<p>The command will create a tar archive in your current directory.</p>
<h2><a id="ecosystems">Ecosystem Support</a></h2>
<p>Any open developer can choose one of the <a href="#public-licenses">public license options</a>, add its text to <code>LICENSE</code>, <a href="#offering-private-liceness">offer private licenses through the API</a>, and link to their <a href="#web-store-pages">web store page</a> in <code>README</code> or on a website.  Users can buy private licenses directly from the web store page, and download their signed license file.  But the process becomes much simpler—much closer to zero friction, for both contributors and users—when the <a href="#command-line-interface">command line interface</a> can find, read, and write package metadata showing which packages correspond to which licensezero.com IDs.</p>
<p>The <a href="#command-line-interface">command line interface</a> finds package metadata by recursing the current working directory, as well as paths provided by queries to dependency-management tools, like <code>bundler show</code> for RubyGems.  When the command line interface finds a <code>licensezero.json</code> file, it inventories the packages listed within it.  It then looks for package-manager metadata files, like <code>setup.py</code>, <code>package.json</code>, or <code>pom.xml</code>, and tries to query them for package scope, name, and version information.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/licensezero/cli/blob/master/LANGUAGES.md"><code>LANGUAGES</code> file in the CLI repository</a> describes current language and packaging support.  If you’re interested in expanding first-class tooling support to your language or package format of choice, <a href="https://github.com/licensezero/cli/issues">reach out in the GitHub repository for the Go port of the CLI</a>.  Even if you can’t contribute code, pointers to documentation, examples of conventions, and answers to questions will be very helpful.</p>
<h2><a id="contributions">Contributions</a></h2>
<p>As a independent software maintainer, you can license your work under both a <a href="#public-license">public <code>LICENSE</code> terms</a> and <a href="#private-licenses">private licenses</a> at the same time because you own the intellectual property in your work that others needs licenses for.  In other words, you can dual license your work because you own it.</p>
<p>When others contribute to your work, they will own the intellectual property in their contributions, not you.  As a result, users of your combined work will need licenses from you and from other contributors.  There are two straightforward ways to achieve that.</p>
<h3><a id="parallel-licensing">Parallel Licensing</a></h3>
<p>You can choose to take contributions to your project only from those who license their contributions under permissive open source terms.  For example, you might license your contributions to a project under <a href="#parity">Parity terms</a>, but ask contributors to license their work under <a href="#permissive-license">Charity</a>, and append the text of that license to your project’s <code>LICENSE</code> file with a note that others’ contributions come under that license.</p>
<p>Users of the combined project would then receive a license from you on <a href="#parity">Parity terms</a>, for your contributions, and licenses from other contributors on the terms of <a href="#permissive-license">Charity</a>, for their contributions.  Would-be users who won’t abide by the open source release conditions of your license can still buy a private license from you, for your contributions.  The private license for your work, plus the permissive license for others’ contributions, cover all contributions.</p>
<p>In that kind of situation, you can sell private licenses for your contributions to the project, but others cannot.  Perhaps that feels completely fair.  If it doesn’t, you may like to offer special credit, payment, or a free <a href="#waiver">waiver</a> to contributors, to convince them to license their contributions under permissive terms.</p>
<h3><a id="stacked-licensing">Stacked Licensing</a></h3>
<p>License Zero also supports projects that require multiple private licenses, for contributions from different developers.  If you publish contributions under <a href="#parity">The Parity Public License</a>, and another developer forks, licensing their own work under <a href="#parity">The Parity Public License</a>, too, they can append <code>licensezero.json</code> metadata for a separate License Zero identifier.  Users who run the <a href="#command-line-interface">command line interface</a> will see that they need a private license from each of you to use the project as a whole.  The same could happen with two contributors using <a href="#prosperity">The Prosperity Public License</a>, or contributors using a mix of <code>LICENSE</code> terms.</p>
<p>Note that as a contributor, you control pricing only for your own contributions, not anyone else’s contributions, even if their work builds on yours.  Contributors building on top of work you license under <a href="#prosperity">The Prosperity Public License</a> will need to purchase private licenses from you to use and build on your work for the purpose of making money through licensezero.com, but otherwise, licensezero.com doesn’t say anything about any relationship between you.</p>
<h3><a id="license-graphs">License Graphs</a></h3>
<p>Packages, tools, and projects depend on other packages, tools, and projects in turn.  These relationships create webs of dependencies, or dependency graphs, within software projects.</p>
<p>Users need licenses for all intellectual property within their software projects, including its dependencies.  And they must follow the rules of each of those licenses.  That means each project tree has not just a dependency graph, but a <em>license graph</em>, as well.  The License Zero command line interface <a href="#as-a-user">traverses the license graph automatically</a>, seeking out License Zero packages.</p>
<p>Consider this dependency graph:</p>
<figure id="figure-1">
  <img src=./figure-1.svg alt="Figure 1">
  <figcaption>Figure 1: A Dependency Graph</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Package A depends on Package B and Package C.  Package C depends on Package D in turn.</p>
<p>When all contributions to each package in the graph are licensed under the same terms, users must follow the rules of that license for all code in the graph:</p>
<figure id="figure-2">
  <img src=./figure-2.svg alt="Figure 2">
  <figcaption>Figure 2: A Dependency Graph Under One License</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>In this case, all the packages in the dependency graph are licensed under <a href="#parity">Parity</a> terms.  Parity allows this, as long as source code for all the packages gets released, and each package preserves the license terms and notices of its dependencies.</p>
<p>However, the licenses for packages in a dependency graph need not be the same:</p>
<figure id="figure-3">
  <img src=./figure-3.svg alt="Figure 3">
  <figcaption>Figure 3: A Dependency Graph Under Different Licenses</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>A user of package A needs to follow the rules of <em>both</em> <a href="#charity">Charity</a> and <a href="#prosperity">Prosperity</a>, in order to use package A.  That means <em>both</em> limiting commercial use to 32 days <em>and</em> releasing source code for software built with package D, including for software built with package C or Package A.</p>
<p>Note that the authors of package A and package C are free to license work on their own packages under MIT and Charity terms, respectively.  The Parity license of package D requires release of source code and licensing on terms at least as permissive as Parity.  Both MIT and Charity are <em>more</em> permissive than Parity, with <em>fewer</em> rules about releasing source code.</p>
<p>The author of package A must mind the license rules for the Prosperity license for package B, too.  If the author of package A wrote that package primarily as a hobby, or as academic research, they’re free to continue using package B indefinitely.  If the author of package A instead wrote package A primarily to make money, they need a private license for contributions to package B, so as not to exceed the 32-day trial period.</p>
<p>The bad news is that license graphs can be even more complex, where packages also used <a href="#stacked-licensing">stacked licensing</a>:</p>
<figure id="figure-4">
  <img src=./figure-4.svg alt="Figure 4">
  <figcaption>Figure 4: A Dependency Graph with Packages Stacking Licenses</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>This kind of complexity shows up even in existing open software projects that don’t use any License Zero licenses, with mixes of GPL, BSD, MIT, LGPL, and other licenses.</p>
<p>The good news is that tools like the <a href="#command-line-interface">license zero command line interface</a> can traverse even complex license graphs automatically, compile a list of every <a href="#identifiers">identifier</a> mentioned in metadata, and compare those results against the licenses and waivers that the user already has.  The License Zero command line interface merely evolves, and specializes, <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/licensee">existing tools for analyzing open source license graphs</a>.</p>
<h2><a id="complementary-approaches">Complementary Approaches</a></h2>
<p>License Zero isn’t the only way to financially support your work on open software, and it strives for maximum compatibility with other methods.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Ask people and companies for money, and hope they give it to you.  Set up a payment link in your <code>README</code> file.  Set yourself up on <a href="https://www.patreon.com">Patreon</a>.  Form a foundation and solicit donations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sell books, stickers, shirts, and other physical goods with your project’s name or logo.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sell or exchange the right to put company advertising, branding, or support acknowledgments in your project’s documentation, on your project’s website or social media accounts, or even in your software itself.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Give paying customers early access to your work ahead of its release as open source, some time later.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Require others to support you financially in order to use a trademark to identify themselves as providers of related products or services.  Trademark licensing for service providers is often coupled with advertising, in the form of a listing among service providers on the project’s website.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Charge companies, conferences, or other venues to train others in the use of your project, in person or remotely.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Charge for access to and use of your time to assist users in using your work.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Apply to grant-making institutions and government entities for financial support, if it aligns with their objectives.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Charge others to install, configure, and run your project on their behalf.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Charge others to integrate your work into their applications or services.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Charge others for work they would like to do, such as bug fixes, feature adds, and other changes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sell proprietary software relating to or enhancing your open project.  For example, many open source database companies license proprietary optimizations, monitoring tools, and replication features.</p>
