# Developer's Guide

This guide lays out the nuts and bolts of License Zero and its approach to sustaining your work in software development.  The guide aims to:

1. Explain how License Zero works.

2. Explain the choices you need to make when using License Zero.

3. Stay up-to-date.

## How License Zero Works

License Zero is made of five pieces:

1. Public licenses give everyone permission to use software, under specific conditions.

2. A web service sells licenses to use software under different conditions.

3. A command-line interface that reads and writes metadata about license terms.

4. Legal terms define the relationship between developers and Artless Devices LLC, the company behind License Zero.

5. Forms for waivers and relicense agreements help developers make their work usable in other ways.
