## <a id="how">How License Zero Works</a>

License Zero is made of five pieces:

1. Public licenses give everyone permission to use software, under certain conditions.

2. A web service sells specific buyers permission to use software, under different conditions.

3. A command-line interface reads and writes metadata about License Zero software.

4. Legal terms define the relationship between developers and Artless Devices LLC, the company behind License Zero.

5. Forms agreements and quotes for other deals developers might like to make about their work.

## Overview

I want to use software I've found online. If the software has a public license---written permission, under intellectual property law, that applies to _everyone_---and I can follow its conditions in my work, then I can go ahead and use the software. If I can't follow the public license's conditions, I need to contact the owner of intellectual property rights in the software, probably the developers or their employers, and get a private license with conditions that I _can_ follow.

I am a hobbyist building a website about electronic music. I find a content management system with a public license. The public license's conditions require noncommerical use. Since I'm not building my website for any commercial purpose, I can meet the conditions of the public license and use the software.

I am a record label building a website to promote new releases. I find the same content management system. Since I want to use it to promote my business and make money, I can't meet the conditions of the public license. That means I can't use the software under the public license. I need a different license, with different conditions, from everybody who owns intellectual property in the software.
